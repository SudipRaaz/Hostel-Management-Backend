1.  While trying to develop backend without scope discussion, I am facing i a lot of problems to adapt to the new requirement feature.
    For which every once a while, i have to change the whole backend architecture. 
    Overall a lot of change requirement are emerging.

    Solution: Scope discussion is necessary.  

    Instances: 
    SeatMng table: accommodating UserID instead of being seatID in user table. Such, users could be easily assigned to seats from Room Management. 

2.  While performing internal API calls in user registration and seat allocation. I was not able to get the individual response to the console and only 
    got the final response code. Which got me dubugging the for little too long and could not pin point the issue. 
    ISSUE here was: i was sending sending seatNumber table's PK id the API but it was checking for seatNumber charfield id instead of PK id which is an
    intentional feature of this app.

    Solved: throughly studied the code as guided by GPT.
